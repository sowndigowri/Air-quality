# Air-quality
Builds a machine learning model to predict AQI from pollutant data, including preprocessing, scaling, and regressors, evaluated with MAE, RMSE, R², enabling predictions for inputs.
#  Air Quality Index Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the Air Quality Index (AQI) using environmental pollutant data and machine learning regression models.

## Features

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature scaling and selection
* Multiple regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, etc.)
* Evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² score
* AQI prediction for new environmental data

## Tech Stack

* Python
* Pandas, NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn
* Google Colab / Jupyter Notebook

## Use Case

Helps monitor pollution levels and supports environmental analysis and decision making.

## How to Run

1. Upload the dataset to the notebook/Colab
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Use the prediction function with new data

## Future Improvements

* Real-time AQI prediction using API data
* Interactive dashboard for visualization
* Time-series forecasting of pollution trends
